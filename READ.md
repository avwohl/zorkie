A lot of the great text adventure games where written in a language
called ZIL which looked a lot like lisp.  Traditionaly this went
thru different translations ZIL -> ZLILCH -> ZIP -> ZIP.  ZIP was then
interpreted to play the game with a human. zip files where named .z
thru .z5 for the 5 version.

I would like each of the following:
 - a compiler in python to go from ZIL directly to any version of .z
 - to the extent possible id like a tool to go the other way as well .z to ZIL.
 - documentaion of ZIL
 - documentation of .z with comments about the different versions

There have a lot of things published on parts of it. See below.
