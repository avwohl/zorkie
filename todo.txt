We have been producing bad .z code with lots of guessing as to why
and not making much progress in being sure the .z produced isn't missing
data. A lot of data has been missing from the .z

First take  look at https://ifarchive.org/indexes/if-archive/infocom/tools/ztools/
See if that can run and disassemble the zork I we have been using for testing.
Disassemble ours and the offical zork I that goes with the source we compile.

2nd make a proposal for a debugging data file that would be emitted with
the .z
 - when emiting code pass a lexer token to every emit
 For code with multiple parts like if then else allow listing multiple tokens.
 Each token that conributes to code should be listed in its emit (See below, for 2nd pass)
 - in the debug info for every location in the output .z be
 able to lookup the source that emited it
 - allow for multiple entries. for example I believe strings are stored
 in a table.  if a string is used in 10 places it might have 10 entries
 - allow the compiler to accept a debug file in addtion to the zil/zilf
 usage: compile once to get the debug file, compile again with debug file,
 have the compiler put out a listing with error comments showing which
 tokens (or lines of code as an option) produced no code output.
