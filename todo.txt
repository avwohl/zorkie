On a forum for interactive fiction a famous writer
of .z tools wrote to us (see below).  Be sure
that we pass all of her tests. We got a lot of flack
on on If forums for poor testing.

Also, as Daniel mentioned, the full set of ZILF test cases may prove useful to you. Since your project is licensed under the GPLv3, you’re free to convert those tests to Python and incorporate them, if you want: see the integration tests, which execute compiled Z-code and thus need a Z-machine interpreter, and the interpreter tests, which test the facilities used to execute macros at compile time.

These are the URLs (you probably can't read them directly, the server doesnt like non humans, but see below for a local copy I got):

https://foss.heptapod.net/zilf/zilf/-/tree/branch/default/test/Zilf.Tests.Integration?ref_type=heads
https://foss.heptapod.net/zilf/zilf/-/tree/branch/default/test/Zilf.Tests/Interpreter?ref_type=heads

I did : hg clone https://foss.heptapod.net/zilf/zilf
The full source is available as ~/esrc/zilf
